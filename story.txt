Standing here on the edge of death, a traitor to the country, my home, I wonder if things could have turned out differently if my brother didn’t die. That day is still etched in my memory, like a shard of glass stuck in the confines of my brain. Crystal clear and 
painful. No pointless, his death was pointless. He wasn’t some big war criminal or a revolutionary, he was just an insignificant metalworker who just happened to be at the wrong factory at the wrong time.
