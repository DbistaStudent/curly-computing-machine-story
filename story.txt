Standing here on the edge of death, a traitor to the country, my home, I wonder if things could have turned out differently if my brother didn’t die. That day is still etched in my memory, like a shard of glass stuck in the confines of my brain. Crystal clear and 
painful. No pointless, his death was pointless. He wasn’t some big war criminal or a revolutionary, he was just an insignificant metalworker who just happened to be at the wrong factory at the wrong time.

It was a Wednesday. A normal day. Too normal. I woke up, showered, brushed my teeth, put on my school unifrom, and yelled at my brother as he ate the last piece of toast. I remember my harsh words exactly. They will forever be my biggest regret. 
As I walked to school, all I could think about was that damn piece of toast. It wasn't until fifth period that I got the call. It was an unknown number so I didn't answer at first. But the kept calling, so on the fourth call I answered.
It was the police, telling me there was an accident at the factory aand I should head to the hospital right away. I don't think I've ran so fast in my entire life. 

As I arrived at the hospital, I didn't know what to think or expect. Was my family going to be there? Was my brother alright? Entering the hospital I talked to the front desk to ask where my brother was. The receptionist told me he was on the top floor. There was no time to waste, I ran for the elevator.
The elevator was being shared among 5 other people. Who knows what they were doing here. Working, visiting a family member, going in for a check up. It didn't matter to me, I just needed to see my brother as soon as possible.
Each person in the elevator slowly got of on their different floors, leaving me alone as the elevator approached the final floor. I was about to see what happened to my brother, and I was scared, nervous, and jittery. The elevator door finally opened, and I ran towards the room.
