Standing here on the edge of death, a traitor to the country, my home, I wonder if things could have turned out differently if my brother didn’t die. That day is still etched in my memory, like a shard of glass stuck in the confines of my brain. Crystal clear and 
painful. No pointless, his death was pointless. He wasn’t some big war criminal or a revolutionary, he was just an insignificant metalworker who just happened to be at the wrong factory at the wrong time.

It was a Wednesday. A normal day. Too normal. I woke up, showered, brushed my teeth, put on my school unifrom, and yelled at my brother as he ate the last piece of toast. I remember my harsh words exactly. They will forever be my biggest regret. 
As I walked to school, all I could think about was that damn piece of toast. It wasn't until fifth period that I got the call. It was an unknown number so I didn't answer at first. But the kept calling, so on the fourth call I answered.
It was the police, telling me there was an accident at the factory aand I should head to the hospital right away. I don't think I've ran so fast in my entire life.
